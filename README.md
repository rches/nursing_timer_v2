<h1>Nursing Timer v2.0</h1>

<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>My daughter was born in 2018, and parenthood hit me hard. While she was two weeks old, I was mid-way learning what javascript was. My first ever "app" was tremendously small, but I made it with love for my wife and daughter. We didn't have a reliable way to know how long my daughter was nursing for when we went to the doctors, so I sat down and hammered my way through a rudimentary application that reported out on those details</p>

<p>Some years later, and wanting to learn React more intimately, I am rebuilding what was jQuery into React, and connecting a database in preperation for my second. I am tremendously excited to rediscover a passion project and plan to keep this updated in time for the new bundle of joy.</p>

<h3>What have you completed and why?</h3>
<p>So far the app is intentionally built to operate off of a primary button (the user will most likely have one hand available on a mobile device). Originally, it was hacky jQuery, but with React, there are opportunities to utilize state to have a responsive app with more data stored. If you are a parent, you know the trip to the doctors is a gauntlet of questions you aren't ready for. This should help out.</p>

<h3>Still To Do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add styling</li>
<li>Begin work on logging to database (most likely firebase)</li>
<li>Refine Functionality</li>
<li>User test</li>
</ul>
